    "# Sod's test problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Sod's test problems are standard benchmarks used to assess the accuracy of numerical solvers. The tests use a classic example of one-dimensional compressible flow: the shock-tube problem. Sod (1978) chose initial conditions and numerical discretization parameters for the shock-tube problem and used these to test several schemes, including Lax-Wendroff and MacCormack's. Since then, many others have followed Sod's example and used the same tests on new numerical methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The shock-tube problem is so useful for testing numerical methods because it is one of the few problems that allows an exact solution of the Euler equations for compressible flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook complements the previous lessons of the course module [_\"Riding the wave: convection problems\"_](https://github.com/numerical-mooc/numerical-mooc/tree/master/lessons/03_wave) with Sod's test problems as an independent coding exercise. We'll lay out the problem for you, but leave important bits of code for you to write on your own. Good luck!\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's a shock tube?\n",
    "\n",
    "A shock tube is an idealized device that generates a one-dimensional shock wave in a compressible gas. The setting allows an analytical solution of the Euler equations, which is very useful for comparing with the numerical results to assess their accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Picture a tube with two regions containing gas at different pressures, separated by an infinitely-thin, rigid diaphragm. The gas is initially at rest, and the left region is at a higher pressure than the region to the right of the diaphragm. At time $t = 0.0 s$, the diaphragm is ruptured instantaneously.  \n",
    "\n",
    "What happens?  \n",
    "\n",
    "You get a shock wave.  The gas at high pressure, no longer constrained by the diaphragm, rushes into the lower-pressure area and a one-dimensional unsteady flow is established, consisting of:\n",
    "\n",
    "* a shock wave traveling to the right\n",
    "* an expansion wave traveling to the left\n",
    "* a moving contact discontinuity\n",
    "\n",
    "The shock-tube problem is an example of a *Riemann problem* and it has an analytical solution, as we said. The situation is illustrated in Figure 1.\n",

    "## The Euler equations\n",

    "The Euler equations govern the motion of an inviscid fluid (no viscosity). They consist of the conservation laws of mass and momentum, and often we also need to work with the energy equation. \n",
